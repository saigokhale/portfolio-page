👋 Hey! I'm Sai

I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).  
Currently, I'm an **AI intern** at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html), working on model optimization for large language models (LLMs). Previously, I worked at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/), Bengaluru, and graduated from Cummins College of Engineering, India.

I'm interested in applied research to build efficient and accessible ML systems. My previous work has spanned several areas, including:

- Developing **data-efficient machine learning** techniques
- Exploring ways to create **ethical and responsible ML models**
- Working on **computer vision** applications

At the DML Lab at Georgia Tech, I'm working on leveraging **vision-language models (VLMs)** for efficient data labeling. Through these experiences, I’ve gained hands-on expertise in designing practical solutions for machine learning systems.

Outside of tech, I love exploring new places, painting, and cooking. I’m always up for a good conversation about innovative ideas in ML systems, or anything creative. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, share ideas, or collaborate!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
