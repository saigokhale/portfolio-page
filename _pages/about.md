Hey! I'm Sai. I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I am currently an AI intern at AMD, working on model optimization for large language models (LLMs). I was previously working at Oracle, Bengaluru and graduated from Cummins College of Engineering, India. 

I'm interested in applied research to build efficient and accessible ML systems. My previous work has spanned several areas, including developing data-efficient machine learning techniques, exploring ways to create ethical and responsible ML models, and working on computer vision applications. At Georgia Tech, I am part of the DML lab, where I focus on leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) to improve the efficiency of data labeling processes. Through these experiences, I’ve gained hands-on expertise in designing practical solutions for machine learning systems.

Outside of tech, I love exploring new places, painting, and cooking. I’m always up for a good conversation about innovative ideas in ML systems, or anything creative. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, share ideas or collaborate!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
